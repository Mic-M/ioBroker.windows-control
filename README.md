## Adapter to control Windows devices

This adapter provides controlling Microsoft Windows devices. It is required the tool GetAdmin being installed on every Windows device which you want to control.
<br>
<strong>Many thanks to [Vladimir Vilisov](https://blog.instalator.ru) for his tool GetAdmin!</strong> 

**Please note:** This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors anonymously to the adapter developer(s). For further details and information on how to disable this error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry). Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.


## Tool GetAdmin

To use this adapter, it is required to run the tool GetAdmin (version 2.6) on each Windows device you want to control.
GetAdmin is a single exe file (776 kB). It was coded by Vladimir Vilisov in Delphi and published [on his Blog instalator.ru](https://blog.instalator.ru/archives/47).
Download:
 1. Primary source: https://blog.instalator.ru/archives/47
 2. If not available, you will find a copy on this adapter's Github site [in the folder "files"](https://github.com/Mic-M/ioBroker.windows-control/tree/master/files).

### Security Note
Please note that the tool GetAdmin allows all users with access to the IP & Port configured (see below) vast control of your device. Please make sure that you secure access to the tool, for example using the windows firewall and allow access only from the IP of your ioBroker Server.

Because of this remote control over your device the GetAdmin tool will obviously look like a trojan horse to some virus scanners. In case of a detection you should carefully check the full results and see if there are any malcious actions detected (most virus scanners already complain about starting / stopping certain Applications / Services on your device, which the tool obviously has to do). But still bear in mind: if anybody else can access GetAdmin, he can control also start / stop Applications on your computer or even shut it down. So make sure only you / this adapter can.

### Configuration

Place the `GetAdmin.exe` file in any folder of your Windows device. Execute the file and set the following:
1. Top left in the "Server" section:
    * IP: the IP address of your ioBroker server
    * Port: `8585` is the standard port. Usually, there is no need to change this port.
2. At the top in the "Options" section: Activate "Minimize on Tray" and "Startup" to autostart the program minimized to the system tray.
3. Confirm with "Save".
